Typing Analyzer 🖥️⌨️
Typing Analyzer is a PC typing analysis software built with Tkinter. It’s designed to provide a more detailed and personalized typing experience than existing tools like Monkeytype, helping users improve their speed and accuracy with targeted practice.

Features ✅
Implemented
Typing Window – type freely or follow provided text.
Finish Stats – WPM, accuracy, and basic performance metrics.
Charts – visualize typing performance after each session.
2-Letter Timing Analysis – measures time between every two letters to identify weaknesses.

Planned
History Tracking – save past typing sessions to monitor long-term progress.
Advanced Charts – highlight slowest letters, fastest/slowest digraphs.
Practice Mode – focus on slow letters or specific 2-letter combinations.
